In order for DHT11.py to work we also need Freenove_DHT.py and setup.py.

DHT11.py should work when doing this:

1. Use cd command to enter 'filename' directory of Python code.
cd ~/Freenove_Kit/Code/Python_Code/'filename'
2. Use Python command to execute code "DHT11.py".
python DHT11.py
After the program is executed, the Terminal window will display the current total number of read times, the 
read state, as well as temperature and humidity values as is shown below.

'filename' depends on underwhat file we say the three python files under.
