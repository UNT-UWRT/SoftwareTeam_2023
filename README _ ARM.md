#ARM NOTES
Spin each motor clockwise and counter-clockwise at speeds and angles specified by the controller.
Two of the motors (base and rotational) has speed and angle controls, while one motor (claw motor) has revolution controls (i.e. do 5 revolutions).
The gear ratio for the motors is 20:1.
Using the RT and LT triggers on an Xbox controller to control the claw rotation and the RB and LB buttons to open and close the claw.
